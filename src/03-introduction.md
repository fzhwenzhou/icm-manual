# Introduction
ICM is a new general computing machine that is designed to be distinguished from the traditional Von Neumann model. It utilizes Interaction Combinators to simplify the hardware design and provide massive parallel capacity. Our goals of defining this machine are:

- A completely open and free architecture for both academic and industry.
- A real architecture that is suitable for hardware implementation, not for only simulation.
- A flexible architecture that is suitable for any applications from embedded systems to computing clusters.
- A parallel architecture that can parallelize anything that can be parallelized automatically.
- Supports multiple floating point standards, including IEEE 754-2008, Intel x87 FP80, FP8, and FP4, for both scientific and machine learning tasks.
